# 42-Piscine-C

The following code is what I would have like to turn in if I had to do the Picsine again.

After having become more confident and familiar with the C langauge, I decided to try to do the piscine exercises again but on my own terms. I tried to produce the best code I could think of at the time, keeping in mind modularity, efficiency and generality. When I had a concern, I looked at different perspectives including but not limited to:

https://github.com/cbg119/42-Piscine
https://github.com/jraleman/42_Piscine-C
These resources have been a great help in helping me pick out certain sections that I thought were brilliant methods to solving the same problem.

My purpose in redoing these exercises was to form a habit in how I should code, to refine what I had learned and to ulitlize some of the tricks I had picked up later in the Piscine. I ended up passing my first attempt at the piscine but my code was crude and merely done to get the task done. I hope that this code has more deliberate choices in the methods employed.

Special thanks to akharrou. I had back and forth conversations with him, criticized/questioned his code from time to time and he was chill and helpful.
